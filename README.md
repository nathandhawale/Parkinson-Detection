# Parkinson-Detection
 
The first thing I did was take a look at the data and then created a correlation heatmap to see where the data is correlated. I then separated the train and test sets before scaling and transorming the data. I then ran an SVM model to predict the accuracy and had a 90% on the train set and an 87% on the test set. I then built a predictive system to determine if the code ran accurately.
